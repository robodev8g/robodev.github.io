This array is the place where we are telling ROS2 which nodes it should know.</p> <p>When we will build the package later, ROS2 will take the python filles we put there and make executables from them. The location where these executables we be stored in is written in the <code>\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5d.\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc54</code> file.</p> <p>If any error occurs you might need to run: <code>\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 ~/.\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60\u210e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc50</code> to sure you have the latest version of your package.</p>"},{"location":"ros/#ros2-run-tool","title":"ROS2 run tool:","text":"<p>Usually we will not run our nodes as described in <code>Running ROS2 Node</code> section.
